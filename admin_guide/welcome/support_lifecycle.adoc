== Support lifecycle

Because the container ecosystem is rapidly evolving, understanding supportability policies is an important part of keeping your environment supportable and secure.
This article describes not only the support policy for Prisma Cloud itself, but also for other software you may integrate it with.

You can always find the most up to date information on available releases, along with download links, on the xref:../welcome/releases.adoc[Releases] page.


=== Definitions

Major Releases (X.Y.z)::
Include significant new features and changes.
These are also known as 'milestones' and include significant new functionality; they are released approximately every four months and include all applicable fixes made in previous releases.
These are versions such as 19.07 and 19.11.

Maintenance Releases (x.y.Z)::
Also known as 'updates', these are released to correct specific problems in previous releases.
They incorporate all applicable defect corrections made in prior Maintenance Releases.
These are versions such as 19.11.480.

End of Life (EOL)::
Versions that are no longer supported by Prisma Cloud.
Updating to a later version is recommended.

Support::
Includes not only resolution of technical issues through interactive assistance, but also fixes delivered in maintenance releases to correct problems.


=== Prisma Cloud supportability policy

Prisma Cloud has an 'n-1' support policy that means the current release ('n') and the previous release ('n-1') receive support.

Note that in some cases, resolution of a problem in the n-1 version may require upgrading to a  current build.
Prisma Cloud will make commercially reasonable efforts to work with customers that require porting fixes back to the n-1 version but sometimes architectural changes are significant enough between versions that this is practically impossible without making the n-1 version essentially the same as the n version.


=== Third party dependencies

The container ecosystem is constantly evolving and there are sometimes requirements from third-party vendors that may impact Prisma Cloud's supportability options.
For example, Prisma Cloud cannot effectively support third-party software that the vendor (or project) itself no longer supports.
This is often most relevant in the case of the Docker Engine itself.  Since Prisma Cloud often adds new features that take advantage of new capabilities in Docker, Prisma Cloud only provides commercial support for versions of Docker that Docker itself supports.
This ensures that updates can be properly tested and supported throughout customers' environments.

For more information about Prisma Cloud's support for Docker, see
xref:../install/system_requirements.adoc#docker[System requirements].

Note that we take the same approach to other technologies that interface with Prisma Cloud, such as the host operating systems, orchestrators, registries, and so on.
In all cases, Prisma Cloud will provide commercially reasonable assistance to try and resolve problems, but it may require upgrading components to vendor supported versions.
