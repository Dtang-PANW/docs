== Zero-day vulnerabilities

Zero-day vulnerabilities are undisclosed holes in software packages that have not been publicly acknowledged or patched by the software provider.
Prisma Cloud has partnered with Exodus Intelligence, a security research firm that does original work on zero-days, to offer coverage for these types of vulnerabilities.

Zero-day vulnerabilities complement Prisma Cloudâ€™s comprehensive coverage for CVEs.
Unlike zero-days, CVEs are publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that are reported by distributions, software vendors, and open source software projects.
