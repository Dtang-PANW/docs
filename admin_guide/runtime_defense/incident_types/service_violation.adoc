== Service violation

Service violation incidents indicate that a service running on a protected host has attempted to use privileges beyond what is expected.

=== Investigation

Determine if the service has any known vulnerabilities by reviewing the applicable information in *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Hosts*.

For additional information, review the Prisma Cloud runtime audit logs, any logs that the service generates, and syslog on the affected host.

=== Mitigation

Resolve any vulnerability and access issues found in the investigation phase.
