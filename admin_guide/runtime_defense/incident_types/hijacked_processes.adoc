== Hijacked processes

A hijacked process incident indicates that an existing process has been used in ways that are inconsistent with its expected behavior.
This type of incident could be a sign that a process has been used to compromise a container.

=== Investigation

The following incident shows that java, which is an expected process in this Struts2 container, has launched a bash shell.
This is decidedly unexpected behavior.
You can also see that it wrote out a suspicious new file named _.java_.

The first step in an investigation is to determine if this is indeed malicious behavior.
Reviewing the audit logs under *Monitor > Events > Container Audits* shows a pattern of behavior that is troubling.
A number of commands are being executed by Java, including a copy of the sensitive _/etc/passwd_ file.

The next step in the investigation is to determine how an attacker was able to hijack the process.
A likely culprit is a vulnerability in the code deployed to the container.
Reviewing the vulnerability scan report for the underlying image shows that it contains a package with a remote code execution vulnerability.
This vulnerability is remotely exploitable and exploit code is readily available.

Reviewing the application logs for this container, with _docker logs <CONTAINER-NAME>_, shows errors consistent with the exploitation of CVE-2017-5638.

=== Mitigation

The first step in mitigating the issue is fixing the root cause and redeploying the image.
Prisma Cloudâ€™s layer view of vulnerabilities shows developers where the vulnerability was introduced.
For this image, you can see that CVE-2017-5638 is present in a _.war_ file downloaded at the end of the Dockerfile.

Additionally, enabling prevention of runtime process events would provide future defense-in-depth.
