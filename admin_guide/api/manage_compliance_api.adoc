== Manage compliance policies with the API

The https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/api/twistlock_api.html[Prisma Cloud API] can be used to automate all aspects of the product.
In this article, we discuss using it to automate management of compliance policies.

For example, you may want to create different compliances for different parts of your environment, but base them all from a common baseline.
Alternatively, you may have a central security or internal audit team that needs to be able to assess compliance across multiple environments.
In both cases, the API helps 'fan out' management of compliance policies.

=== Creating and editing policies

Prisma Cloud uses a single API (a single object) to update all compliance policies at once.
This makes it easy to keep a strict order between the policies.
The process of adding, editing, or removing a policy is the same:

. Get all policies (returns JSON).
. Modify the JSON output according to your needs.
. Update policies by pushing the new JSON payload.

[.procedure]
. Get all policies

  $ curl -k -u admin:admin https://127.0.0.1:8083/api/v1/policies/compliance

. Modify the JSON output, explanatory comments provided after //

Where:

*1* -- Obsolete.

*2* -- You can specify multiple resources of the same type.
+
*3* -- Compliance rules are called vulnerabilities as well.
+
*4* -- Compliance rule ID.
+
*5* -- Block on compliance rule 510.
If vuln is unspecified, the effect is ignore.
+
*6* -- Compliance rule ID.
+
*7* -- Alert on compliance rule 511.
+
*8* -- Not relevant
+
*9* -- User who created the rule.
+
*10* -- Name of the rule.
+
NOTE: If any policy is modified or deleted here, this will replace the existing policies in Console when uploaded. For any policy to remain unchanged / undeleted, please keep it as is in the file.

. Update policies, where policy_upload.txt contains the JSON payload.

  $ curl -k -u admin:admin -X PUT -H "Content-Type:application/json" https://127.0.0.1:8083/api/v1/policies/compliance --data-binary "@policy_upload.txt"
+
You can find a sample policy https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/attachments/policy_upload.txt[here].


=== Getting compliance results

Compliance results can also be retrieved via the API.

For example, to get the compliance status of containers:

  $ curl -k -u admin:admin https://127.0.0.1:8083/api/v1/health/containers

Which returns:

[source,json]
----
  "compliance_vulnerabilities": [{
      "text": "",
      "id": 599,
      "severity": "high",
      "cvss": 0,
      "cve": "",
      "description": "Container is running as root",
      "type": "container",
      "package_name": "",
      "package_version": "",
      "extension": null,
      "_id": "5783349a8485601100a33f3b"
  }, {
      "text": "",
      "id": 51,
      "severity": "high",
      "cvss": 0,
      "cve": "",
      "description": "Verify AppArmor Profile, if applicable (CIS 5.1)",
      "type": "container",
      "package_name": "",
      "package_version": "",
      "extension": null,
      "_id": "5783349a8485601100a33f3a"
  }, ...
----

To filter results, use the id parameter:

  $ curl -k -u admin:admin "https://127.0.0.1:8083/api/v1/health/containers?id=4cba*"

Or, use the name parameter (offset and limit must also be included):

  $ curl -k -u admin:admin "https://127.0.0.1:8083/api/v1/health/containers?offset=0&limit=10&search=distracted_yona"

Use the "scan_time" property of the scan result to determine if the scan is completed.

  $ curl -k -u admin:admin "https://127.0.0.1:8083/api/v1/health/containers?offset=0&limit=10&search=distracted_yona"

Which returns:

[source,json]
----
[
 {
  "_id":"577dee9a8485601100a332a5",
  "scan_time":"2016-07-11T08:09:01.541Z",
  "hostname":"dima-debian-8-demo.c.dima-rack.internal",
  "info":{
     "name":"distracted_yonath",
     "id":"4cba09825cdad40d0cc68ff6426bbc2573e20f266c18aa61a0c5d4fede0f5d2a",

     "image":"docker.io/dimastopel/testsyscalls5:latest",
     "app":"node server.js",
     "network_settings":{

        ...
----

The scan request returns the time the scan started (see below).
Repeat the request until the scan time of the result is greater than the one you received from scan request.
We recommend checking every 10 seconds; few scans should take more than 20-30 seconds to complete.

  $ curl -k -u admin:admin -X POST https://127.0.0.1:8083/api/v1/health/containers/scan
  {"scanTime":"2016-07-11T08:12:29.228Z"}
