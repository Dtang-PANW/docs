[NOTE]
====
You can run the Prisma Cloud scanner inside a container using the 'containerized' flag.
Scanning from inside a container is only required for special situations, such as xref:../howto/openshift_build_twistcli_scanning.adoc[integrating Prisma Cloud scanning into the OpenShift build process].

      steps {
        prismaCloudScanImage ca: '', cert: '', containerized:true, ...

    }    
    ...
}

When using the containerized mode, image ID won't be displayed in the scan results (only image name).
