== High Availability

Console can be deployed in an HA configuration using either your
orchestrator's HA capabilities or Prisma Cloud built-in HA capability.
Prisma Cloud built-in HA capability are provided for customers that want to
run Console on hosts that are not under the control of a cluster
manager.

When leveraging a SaaS hosted Console, HA is automatically provided.

In general, we recommend that you use your orchestrator's native
availability features. If you are using an orchestrator for HA, do not
enable Console's built-in HA capabilities.

When you deploy Console on multiple hosts, Prisma Cloud built-in HA ensures
that one Console is always available, even if a host fails. Prisma Cloud HA
creates a high availability clusters from redundant hosts running
Console in an active-passive configuration, and automatically manages
cluster membership, leader election, and failover.
