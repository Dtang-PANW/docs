=== Upcoming breaking changes

In the next major release of Prisma Cloud Compute, we will deprecate the following endpoints.
These endpoints are used internally by the UI to get a list of table filters.
For sorting and filtering results, retrieve the full data set (e.g. /api/v1/containers), and use tools like jq and Python to filter and sort.

* _/api/v1/containers/filters_
* _/api/v1/hosts/filters_
* _/api/v1/scans/filters_
* _/api/v1/profiles/container/filters_
* _/api/v1/audits/mgmt/filters_
